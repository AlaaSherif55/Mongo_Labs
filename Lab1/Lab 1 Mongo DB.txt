1. Create database named: FacultySystemDB.
      use FacultySystemDB 
2. Create collection (student) that has:
	● FirstName: string, LastName: string, Age: Number, Faculty: An object that
	has Name and Address
	● Grades: An array of objects, each object has: CourseName, Grade, Pass
	(Boolean).
	● IsFired: Boolean


3. Insert 3 (at least) documents in Student collection with different values.
	● Try inserting one record each time
	
db.student.insertOne({FirstName:"esraa",LastName:"Sherif",Age:23,Faculty:["translation","ain shames"],Grades:[{CourseName:"or",Grade:60,Pass:false}],IsFired:true})

	● Try inserting many students using one insert statement.
	
db.student.insertMany([
{FirstName:"ali",LastName:"emad",Age:25,Faculty:["it","iti"],Grades:[{CourseName:"problem solving",Grade:89,Pass:true}],IsFired:true},
{FirstName:"essam",LastName:"Sherif",Age:30,Faculty:["iot","alex"],Grades:[{CourseName:"simulate",Grade:75,Pass:false}],IsFired:true}
])

db.student.find({})
	● Student with specific First Name.
	db.student.find({FirstName:"alaa"})
	
	● Students who his First Name=Ahmed, or Last Name= Ahmed.
	db.student.find({$or:[{FirstName:"ahmed"},{LastName:"ahmed"}]})

	db.student.find({FirstName:{$ne:"ahmed"}})

	● Students with Age more than or equal to 21, and their faculty isn't NULL.
	db.student.find({Age:{$gte:21},Faculty:{$ne:null}})
	
	● Display student with specific First Name, and display his First Name, 
	  Last name, IsFired fields only.
	  db.student.find({FirstName:"alaa"},{FirstName:1,LastName:1,IsFired:1,_id:0})
	  
5. Update the student with specific FirstName, and change his LastName.
db.student.updateOne({FirstName:"alaa"},{$set:{LastName:"omar"}})

6. Delete Fired students.
db.student.deleteMany({IsFired:true})

7. Delete all students collection.
